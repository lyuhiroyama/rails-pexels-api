# About this project

- A Ruby on Rails web app that allows users to display photos from their Pexels collections.
- The app connects to the Pexels API to fetch the images.
- Users enter a collection ID to view all photos in that collection.
- Each collection displays multiple photos along with their photographer information.
- API keys are stored in a .env file to keep credentials safe.
